The Phong model for shading is based on three components:
ambient, diffuse, and specular.

The total color of a point on a surface is computed as the sum of these three components.
The general formula for the Phong model is:

I = Ia + Id + Is

where I is the total color of the surface at a point,
Ia is the ambient component,
Id is the diffuse component, and
Is is the specular component.

The ambient component represents the overall light in the environment and
is typically a constant color value. It is computed as:

Ia = ka * La

where ka is the ambient reflection coefficient, and La is the ambient light color.

DIFFUSE
The diffuse component represents the color of the surface due to light that is scattered
in all directions. It is computed using the Lambertian cosine law as:

Id = kd * Ld * max(0, N · L)

where kd is the diffuse reflection coefficient,
Ld is the diffuse light color,
N is the surface normal, and
L is the light direction. We use the shadow ray as "Light Direction" and therefore have to 
multiply by -1 at the end.

The specular component represents the highlight on the surface due to light that is reflected
in a specific direction.
It is computed using the Phong specular reflection model as:

Is = ks * Ls * max(0, R · V)^s

where ks is the specular reflection coefficient,
Ls is the specular light color,
R is the reflected light direction,
V is the view direction,
and s is the shininess coefficient.

The reflected light direction R is computed as:

R = 2 * (N · L) * N - L

where N is the surface normal and L is the light direction.

The view direction V is the direction from the surface point towards the camera or viewer.

Overall, the Phong model provides a simple yet effective way to compute the shading of a surface in a ray tracing or rendering algorithm.
