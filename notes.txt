Ray Plane Intersection

Ray formula:
	r(t) = o + t * d
	Where
		o is the point of the ray
		t is the distance traveled (our target value later)
		d is the defining vector of the ray
Plane formula:
	(p' - p) * n = 0
	Where
		p' is the evaluated point
		p is the point of the plane
		n is the defining vector of the plane
	Means that the vector connecting p and the evaluated point p'
	is orthogonal to the plane's normvector and therefore in the plane.
Integrate ray into plane formula instead of p':
	(r(t) - p) * n = 0
	((o + t * d) - p) * n = 0
Solve for t:
	((o + td) - p) * n = 0
	(o + td)n - pn = 0
	on + tdn - pn = 0
	tdn = pn - on
	t = (pn - on) / (dn)
	or
	t = [(p - o) * n] / [d * n] -> used in the function
Cases
1)	If dividend is smaller than EPSILON:
	Ray starts in plane -> immediate intersection (return 0)
2)	If divisor is smaller than EPSILON:
	Ray is parallel to plane -> no intersection (return INFINITY)
3)	If result is negative:
	Intersection point is behind ray -> no intersection (return INFINITY)
4)	Intersection found -> one intersection (return dividend / divisor)

Ray Sphere Intersection

Sphere formula: ||(p - c)||² = r²
	c = center of sphere
	r = radius of sphere
	p = point on sphere
	||x|| means length/magnitude of the vector x
insert ray formula for point p and solve for t to get a
quadratic equation. Solve that to get the discriminants:

if (discriminant < 0)
	return (INFINITY);
	-> no intersection
if (discriminant == 0)
	return (-b / (2 * a));
	-> only one intersection point (tangent)
if (intrsct2 < 0)
	return (INFINITY);
	-> sphere behind ray, no intersection
if (intrsct1 >= 0)
	return (intrsct1);
	-> 2 intersections but we only want intrsct1
	intrsct2 however is also valid (if ray passes thru sphere)
return (intrsct2);
	-> ray originates inside sphere if intrsct1 < 0, one intersection

Ray Cylinder Intersection

Split problem into 3 parts:
-	Solve for endless tube
-	Delimit tube
-	Solve for the caps

Infinite cylinder along y axis of radius r has equation
x² + z² - r² = 0.
The equation for a more general cylinder of radius r
oriented along a line p_a + v_a * t:
(q - pa - (va,q - pa)va)2 - r2 = 0
where q = (x,y,z) is a point on the
cylinder.
